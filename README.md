# Task Manager App for CVWO Application 2022

## Task
The task for this project is to build a fullstack task manager app, and was done over the winter break.

The target audience is self defined, where in this case it would be for the general public.

Some features being implemented include:

- Tag System (Users are able to assign a tag to their tasks)
- Filter out the tasks by tags
- Update status of tasks and delete them
- User authentication 

## Libraries + Languages
**Frontend:** ReactJS

**Backend:** Go

**Database:** MySQL

ReactJS libraries used include:

- MaterialUI
- React Router Dom

## Project Demo
The project is hosted on Netlify. You can find it [here](https://cvwo-task-manager.netlify.app/).

The backend is hosted on Heroku. To view the backend code, click [here](https://github.com/RyanCheungJF/CVWO-Backend).


## Future Considerations/ Additions
- Finish clean `typescript` build and run without errors, incorporate `Redux`
- Use less of Material UI and custom style elements using `TailwindCSS`
- Base code could've been written with `typescript` from the start
- Add and EditPage to edit the whole task, as well as add success Snackbars


## Lessons Learnt
- React (Routing, States and Hooks)
- API Calls on Frontend
